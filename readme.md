# OBSOLETE
This mod is absolete and I am going to remove it some time in the future.
Use https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405917899 instead which is the superior alternative for all usecases.

# Short Description
Adds the ability to demolish certain mod roads or to replace them with colossal order roads if feasible.

# Long description
I love Network Extensions 1 & 2 and other mods that brought us more roads.
What I don't like is redundancy, menu clutter and unnecessary loading times.
Mass Transit brought us a few roads that were previosly only available in Network Extensions.
Yet we can't deactivate these roads in NEXT2 before we upgrade them all to the Colossal Order versions, else our saves break.
The process of finding, demolishing or upgrade all these pieces can be tedious for very large cities.
So I made us a little tool in order to make the process easier.
Hope you like it.

Stations associated with certain mods.
Colossal Order roads and tracks maybe?
Stuff that you would like to see, just tell me.

# How?
After you enabled the mod ingame, load a map.
Now there is a list in the mod options where you can either demolish or replace a road type if feasible.
